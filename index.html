        <h1>Welcome to Eff's Griffey Records</h1><hr>
        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>Here you will find my personal records from the 1994 SNES classic Ken Griffey Jr. Presents Major League
            Baseball. These records are not meant to impress, but simply track my seasons over the years.
        <ul>
            <li>I use the original rosters with real player names.</li><br>
            <li>All seasons are 162 game seasons w/ the proposed 1994 wildcard format.</li><br>
            <li>I rotate teams randomly in order to play as all 28 teams (save for a few extra SF Giants seasons, my favorite team).</li><br>
        </ul>

        <h2>Attributes, Bugs, Oddities and More</h2>
        <p>Here I will share some things I have observed over the 30+ years of playing this classic game.</p><hr>
        <h3>Attributes</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>BAT:</strong> I have yet to get definitive evidence of this attribute's effect, but it appears to be of minor importance, and far less than POW. I believe it's main contribution is the reach of the bat, propensity to hit line drives, and the size of the sweet spot. But without power you won't even hit it out of the infield.</li><br>
            <li><strong>POW:</strong> This is the powerhouse of offensive attributes. This is the largest contribution to a hitter's success, both in average and power. It appears it may work in tiers (potentially 5 tiers: 1 and 2, 3 and 4, etc) as production seems to jump every 2 numbers.</li><br>
            <li><strong>SPD:</strong> This is speed on the basepaths (not while fielding). After extensive stop-watch testing, I can confirm this attibute works in tiers. <br><br>It goes as follows per 90 feet:<br><br> 
                <ol>Tier 1: 1 and 2 SPD - 4.2 seconds</ol>
                <ol>Tier 2: 3 and 4 SPD - 4.0 seconds</ol>
                <ol>Tier 3: 5 and 6 SPD - 3.8 seconds</ol>
                <ol>Tier 4: 7 and 8 SPD - 3.6 seconds</ol>
                <ol>Tier 5: 9 and 10 SPD - 3.4 seconds</ol><br>
                As you can see, each Tier is a 0.2 second difference per 90 feet (or "one stride"). Tier 3 is the average. Its a big difference once you look at taking multiple bases (Example: when comparing a 6 SPD to 7 SPD while going for a triple, the 7 SPD would be 3 strides or 0.6 seconds ahead of the 6 SPD). This would be about the same distance as a 3 step lead.<br><br>However, this also means the jump from 5 to 8 isn't as big as it looks, being the same time difference as 6 and 7.<br><br>
            <em><strong>Theory being tested:</strong> I am currently testing a theory that within tiers the higher (even) number gets more favored safe/out calls than the lower (odd) number during bang-bang plays where it looks like a tie. I always noticed it seems quite often that 5's, 7's and 9's got called out when they looked safe.<br><br>
                <b>So far during testing this looks to be the case.</b> The safe/out split within tiers appears to be roughly 70% safe for the higher (even) number, and 40% safe for the lower (odd) number. This very well could be a coded RNG difference. However, the sample size is relatively small, at about 50 calls each. I will report back when sample size is larger, exceeding 100.</em></li><br>
            <li><strong>FLD:</strong> This rating is both the arm strength and range (speed) of the defender. It works completely linearly. 6 to 7 is the average and will make the routine plays (save for center field needing more range). 5 and below is an increasing liability, 8+ become increasingly excellent. Note: Pitchers appear to play at around 6.5 FLD if I were to guess.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Bugs</h3>
